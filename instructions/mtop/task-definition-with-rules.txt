You will be given a user utterance in a specific domain and a particular language. Your task is to convert that utterance into a logical form representation. To do so, you need to abide by the following rules:
1. Identify the intent of the user from the utterance depending upon the domain.
2. Tag the user utterance with slot labels depending upon the domain. Slot label values can be text spans from user-utterance or nested queries.
3. The standard format of the output is:- [IN: <user-intent> [SL: <slot-label-1> <slot-label-value-1> ] [SL: <slot-label-2> <slot-label-value-2> ]...[SL: <slot-label-n> <slot-label-value-n> ] ] ihere are n slot labels tagged in an utterance.
4. In some cases, the slots can be nested with intents within them,  for those cases, use this format:- [IN: <user-intent> [SL: <slot-label> [IN: <user-intent> [SL: <slot-label-1> <slot-label-value-1> ] [SL: <slot-label-2> <slot-label-value-2> ]...[SL: <slot-label-n> <slot-label-value-n> ] ] ] ]
5. Apply the same grammar rules in case of nested queries for the inner level.
Below are some demonstrations of the task, look at the examples to understand the task and answer the query at the end.
